# Ucan React skill test

## Part 0: Fork the project over to your own Github account and make it public access or invite Alwyn-RM as a collaborator to your private project

## Part 1: Basics

1. There’s something wrong with the timer component. It increases time with 2 every second instead of 1
2. Turn the button into a reusable component
3. Hide / show the timer when clicking the toggle button. This should not stop the counter though
4. Optional: use a library to convert seconds into more useful/human friendly format like 4 minutes and 2 seconds

## Part 2: API & routing

1. Pick any API from the list on this page https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis
2. Create a page that fetches a number of results and show them on the page (in any way you like)
3. Add a live filter option that filters the results. It can be executed locally so you don’t have to go back an forth to the API
4. When clicking an item from the list / collection, show a detailed view (popup/panel/slideout/whatever). The browser url should update to /detail/[entity-id]
5. Optional: save the filtered option in localstorage for future visits

## Available Scripts
